- 👋 Hi, I’m @albertofrison
- 👀 I’m interested in learning R and Data Science
- 🌱 I’m currently learning the R language and basic Data Science tools
- 📚 I'm currently enrolled in the EdX - Harvard Data Science Professional Certificate Program: I really enjoy it.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on simple, basic Data Science projects based on R (not Python, as I cannot allot any more time in learning a new language)
- 📫 How to reach me... through a DM in LinkedIn https://www.linkedin.com/in/albertofrison/
